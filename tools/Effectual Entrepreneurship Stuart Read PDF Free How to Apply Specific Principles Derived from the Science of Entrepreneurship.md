## What is Effectual Entrepreneurship?
 
Effectual entrepreneurship is a way of thinking and acting that focuses on creating new opportunities rather than exploiting existing ones. It is based on the methods of expert entrepreneurs who have successfully launched and grown businesses in uncertain and unpredictable environments. Effectual entrepreneurship challenges some of the conventional wisdom about entrepreneurship, such as the need for a detailed business plan, a clear vision of the future, and a large amount of resources. Instead, effectual entrepreneurs use the following principles:
 
- **Bird-in-hand principle:** Start with what you have, such as your skills, passions, network, and resources, rather than what you need.
- **Affordable loss principle:** Invest only what you can afford to lose, rather than what you expect to gain.
- **Crazy quilt principle:** Build partnerships with people who are willing to commit to your idea, rather than trying to convince everyone.
- **Lemonade principle:** Embrace surprises and turn them into opportunities, rather than avoiding or minimizing them.
- **Pilot-in-the-plane principle:** Control the future by creating it, rather than predicting or adapting to it.

## Why is Effectual Entrepreneurship Important?
 
Effectual entrepreneurship is important because it helps entrepreneurs to cope with uncertainty and complexity in today's world. It enables entrepreneurs to create new value for themselves and others by solving problems and fulfilling needs that are not yet met. It also empowers entrepreneurs to be more creative, flexible, and resilient in the face of challenges and failures. Effectual entrepreneurship is not only relevant for starting new businesses, but also for innovating within existing organizations, pursuing social causes, or pursuing personal goals.
