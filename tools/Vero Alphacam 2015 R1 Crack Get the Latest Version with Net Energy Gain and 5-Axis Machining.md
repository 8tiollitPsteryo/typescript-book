## New Advanced 5-Axis Machining Module
 
One of the most significant additions to Vero Alphacam 2015 R1 is the new advanced 5-axis machining module, which is based on the Moduleworks technology. This module allows users to create complex and high-quality toolpaths for surface and solid models, using a variety of strategies such as swarf, multi-axis contouring, flowline, pencil and constant cusp.
 
The module also provides advanced tool axis control and intelligent collision avoidance, which ensure optimal tool orientation and smooth motion. Users can also analyse and optimise their toolpaths using the 5-axis independent toolpath optimiser, which checks for machine tool constraints and suggests the best possible solutions.
 
The new advanced 5-axis machining module is ideal for applications such as aerospace, automotive, medical and mould and die, where precision and accuracy are essential.
 
## New Ribbon Bar Interface
 
Vero Alphacam 2015 R1 introduces a new ribbon bar interface that brings the software up to date with the latest interface technology. The ribbon bar organises commands in logical groups under tabs, such as File, Home, Geometry, Machining and Tools. Each tab relates to a type of activity, such as creating geometry or machining. Clear icons and text labels ensure that commands are easily recognisable and accessible.
 
The ribbon bar also includes a Quick Access Toolbar that can be displayed above or below the ribbon bar. The Quick Access Toolbar contains the most commonly used commands, such as Open and Save. Users can customise the ribbon bar by adding their own favourites or removing unwanted commands.
 
The new ribbon bar interface makes it easier for users to navigate and use the software, as well as enhancing its appearance and functionality.
