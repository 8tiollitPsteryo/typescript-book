If you want to buy Wowza Media Server 3.x.x Perpetual Edition for Windows, you may have some difficulties finding it online. This is because Wowza has discontinued this version and replaced it with Wowza Streaming Engine 4.x.x, which is the latest and most advanced version of their software.
 
However, if you still prefer to use Wowza Media Server 3.x.x Perpetual Edition for Windows, you may be able to find some resellers or partners who still have some license keys available. You can also contact Wowza directly and ask them if they can provide you with a license key for this version.
 
A perpetual license key allows you to use Wowza Media Server on a single server instance without any expiration date or subscription fees. You can also access all the premium AddOn capabilities that are included in the software download, such as nDVR, DRM, Transcoder, and StreamLock. However, you will need to purchase separate AddOn license keys to activate these features.
 
Alternatively, you can also consider using Wowza Media Server Daily Edition, which is a pay-as-you-go option that lets you use Wowza Media Server for occasional or sporadic events. You can buy a daily license key for $5 per day per server instance and use it for up to 24 hours. This edition also includes all the premium AddOn capabilities without any additional fees.
