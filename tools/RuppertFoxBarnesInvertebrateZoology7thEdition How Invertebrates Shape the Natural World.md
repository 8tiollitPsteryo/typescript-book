Invertebrate zoology is the study of animals without a backbone, which make up more than 90% of all living animal species. Invertebrates are diverse and fascinating creatures that inhabit almost every habitat on Earth, from the deep sea to the desert. They play important roles in ecosystems, such as pollination, decomposition, predation, and parasitism. They also have a long and rich evolutionary history that reveals how life has adapted to different environments and challenges.
 
One of the most comprehensive and authoritative textbooks on invertebrate zoology is *Invertebrate Zoology: A Functional Evolutionary Approach*, written by Edward E. Ruppert, Richard S. Fox, and Robert D. Barnes. The seventh edition of this book was published in 2003 by Thomson Brooks/Cole. It covers all major groups of invertebrates, from protozoans to echinoderms, with an emphasis on function, physiology, and reproductive biology. It also integrates modern phylogenetic analysis and molecular techniques to explore the evolutionary relationships among the invertebrate phyla.

The book is divided into 19 chapters, each focusing on a different group of invertebrates or a theme related to invertebrate biology. The chapters are organized into four parts: Part I introduces the basic concepts and methods of invertebrate zoology; Part II covers the protozoans and the simplest metazoans; Part III deals with the bilaterally symmetrical animals; and Part IV examines the deuterostomes and their relatives. Each chapter includes an overview, learning objectives, key terms, summary, review questions, references, and suggested readings. The book also features numerous illustrations, tables, boxes, and photographs that enhance the understanding of the text.
 
*Invertebrate Zoology: A Functional Evolutionary Approach* is a valuable resource for students and instructors of zoology, biology, ecology, and evolution. It provides a thorough and up-to-date survey of the diversity, structure, function, and evolution of invertebrates. It also stimulates curiosity and appreciation for the amazing world of invertebrates.
  
One of the strengths of *Invertebrate Zoology: A Functional Evolutionary Approach* is its integration of functional and evolutionary perspectives. The authors explain how the anatomy, physiology, and behavior of invertebrates are shaped by natural selection and adaptation to their environments. They also show how the comparative study of invertebrates can reveal the common patterns and principles that underlie biological diversity. The book illustrates how invertebrates have evolved various solutions to similar problems, such as locomotion, feeding, respiration, excretion, reproduction, and defense.
 
Another strength of the book is its incorporation of recent advances in molecular biology and phylogenetics. The authors use molecular data and cladistic methods to reconstruct the evolutionary history and relationships of invertebrates. They also discuss how molecular techniques can be used to investigate the genetics, development, and ecology of invertebrates. The book reflects the current state of knowledge and research in invertebrate zoology, while also acknowledging the gaps and uncertainties that remain.
