Europa Universalis IV (Eu4) is a grand strategy game that lets you explore and conquer the world from the late Middle Ages to the early modern era. However, if you want to experience different historical scenarios or play as different countries that are not in the base game, you might want to try some of the many mods available for Eu4.
  
One of the most popular and comprehensive mods is Extended Timeline, which extends the playable timeline from 2 AD to 9999 AD, adding hundreds of new countries, provinces, religions, cultures, technologies, events and decisions. You can play as ancient Rome, medieval China, modern USA or futuristic Japan, among many others.

## Step 1: Download the mod files
  
The first thing you need to do is to download the mod files from a reliable source. You can find the latest version of Extended Timeline mod on its official thread at the Paradox forums[^1^]. You will need to register an account and link your Eu4 game to access the thread. Alternatively, you can download the mod from Mod DB[^2^], a website that hosts many mods for various games.

Once you have downloaded the mod files, you will get a zip file that contains two files: a .mod file and a folder with the same name as the mod. For example, if you downloaded Extended Timeline v.1.28 Golden Century (update), you will get a zip file with two files: Extended\_Timeline\_v.1.28\_Golden\_Century\_(update).mod and Extended\_Timeline\_v.1.28\_Golden\_Century\_(update) folder.
  
## Step 2: Extract the mod files
  
The next thing you need to do is to extract the mod files from the zip file. You can use any program that can open zip files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. To extract the files, right-click on the zip file and choose "Extract here" or "Extract to" and select a destination folder.
  
After extracting the files, you should have two files: a .mod file and a folder with the same name as the mod. For example, if you extracted Extended Timeline v.1.28 Golden Century (update), you should have two files: Extended\_Timeline\_v.1.28\_Golden\_Century\_(update).mod and Extended\_Timeline\_v.1.28\_Golden\_Century\_(update) folder.
  
## Step 3: Move the mod files
  
The final thing you need to do is to move the mod files to the correct location where Eu4 can recognize them. The location depends on where you installed Eu4 and what operating system you are using.
  
If you are using Windows, the default location is C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\mod. If you are using Mac OS X, the default location is ~/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Europa Universalis IV/mod. If you are using Linux, the default location is ~/.local/share/Paradox Interactive/Europa Universalis IV/mod.
  
To move the mod files, simply copy and paste or drag and drop both the .mod file and the folder with the same name as the mod to the mod folder. For example, if you want to move Extended Timeline v.1.28 Golden Century (update), copy and paste or drag and drop both Extended\_Timeline\_v.1.28\_Golden\_Century\_(update).mod and Extended\_Timeline\_v.1.28\_Golden\_Century\_(update) folder to C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\mod (or equivalent).
  
## Step 4: Launch Eu4 and enable the mod
