Writing Papers in the Biological Sciences is a concise and self-teaching guide that covers the most common writing assignments in undergraduate biology courses. It is modeled on a handbook format, with bulleted rules, checklists, and a spiral binding that make it easy to use and refer to. It also includes annotated student examples that illustrate how to apply the guidelines and principles to different types of papers and presentations.
 
The book is divided into three parts. Part I covers the basics of scientific writing and communication, such as locating and using biological literature, citing sources, avoiding plagiarism, and writing with clarity and precision. Part II focuses on writing and documenting research papers and lab reports, from finding a topic and developing a hypothesis to presenting results and discussing implications. Part III deals with other forms of biological writing, such as writing reviews, research proposals, letters of application, resumes, cover letters, and oral presentations.
 
Writing Papers in the Biological Sciences is suitable for students at all levels of biology, from introductory to advanced courses. It also covers topics that are relevant to other sub-disciplines of biology, such as cellular and molecular biology, animal ecology, microbiology, and plant physiology. The book is updated with the latest information on research methods, accessible tools for collaboration and organization, media literacy, and scientific versus science writing.
