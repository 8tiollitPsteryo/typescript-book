Hindu law is based on the concept of dharma, which means duty, righteousness, justice, morality, and harmony. Dharma is derived from the eternal order of the universe, known as rta, which is manifested by God or the Absolute OM. Dharma guides the actions and conduct of all living beings according to their nature and stage of life.
  
Hindu law is not a fixed or rigid system of rules, but rather a dynamic and evolving one that adapts to changing times and circumstances. Hindu law is also not a uniform or monolithic one, but rather a diverse and pluralistic one that reflects the different schools, sects, traditions, and customs of Hinduism. Hindu law is also not a secular or separate one, but rather an integral and inseparable one that encompasses all aspects of life, both spiritual and temporal.
  
Hindu law is derived from various sources, such as the Vedas, the Smritis, the Dharmashastras, the Puranas, the Itihasas, the Agamas, the Shastras, the commentaries, the digests, the customs, the precedents, and the legislation. Among these sources, the Vedas are considered the most authoritative and sacred, as they contain the eternal and revealed knowledge of God. The Smritis are considered the next in importance, as they contain the human-made laws based on reason and tradition. The Dharmashastras are considered the most comprehensive and systematic treatises on Hindu law, written by sages such as Manu, Yajnavalkya, Narada, Parashara, and others.
