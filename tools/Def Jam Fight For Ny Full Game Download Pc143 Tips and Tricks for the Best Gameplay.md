There are five different styles to choose from: street fighting, wrestling, kickboxing, submission, and martial arts. Each style has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique moves and combos that you can learn and use in battle. Here are some tips on how to master your fighting style in Def Jam: Fight for NY:

- Learn new moves and combos. As you progress through the story mode, you will earn development points that you can use to learn new moves and combos from various mentors. You can also unlock new moves by defeating certain opponents or completing challenges. Learning new moves and combos will give you more options and variety in combat, as well as increase your damage and blaze meter.
- Practice your moves and combos. To master your fighting style, you need to practice your moves and combos until they become second nature. You can practice your moves and combos in the training mode or in any arena that you have unlocked. You can also watch replays of your fights to see what moves and combos work best for you and what mistakes you need to avoid.
- Know your strengths and weaknesses. Each fighting style has its own advantages and disadvantages that you need to be aware of. For example, street fighters have powerful punches and haymakers, but they are vulnerable to grapples and submissions. Wrestlers have strong grapples and slams, but they are slow and lack range. Kickboxers have fast and long-range kicks, but they are weak against counters and reversals. Submission fighters have effective holds and submissions, but they are not very good at striking. Martial artists have flashy and acrobatic moves, but they are not very damaging or reliable.
- Adapt to your opponent and environment. Depending on who you are fighting and where you are fighting, you may need to adjust your fighting style accordingly. For example, if you are fighting a wrestler, you may want to avoid grappling and focus on striking. If you are fighting a kickboxer, you may want to close the distance and use grapples or counters. If you are fighting in a crowded arena, you may want to use the environment and the crowd to your advantage.
