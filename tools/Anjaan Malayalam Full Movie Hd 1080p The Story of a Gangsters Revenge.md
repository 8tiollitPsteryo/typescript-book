Anjaan is a film that tries to be a stylish action thriller, but fails to impress with its lack of originality and logic. The film relies heavily on Suriya's star power and charisma, but does not give him enough scope to showcase his acting skills. The film also wastes the talents of other actors like Vidyut Jammwal, Manoj Bajpayee, and Samantha Ruth Prabhu, who have very little to do in the film. The film also suffers from a weak script, poor editing, and a predictable climax.
 
Anjaan is a film that could have been a lot better if it had focused more on the story and the characters, rather than on the style and the glamour. The film has some moments of entertainment and thrill, but they are overshadowed by the flaws and the cliches. The film is a disappointment for the fans of Suriya and Lingusamy, who have delivered better films in the past. Anjaan is a film that can be watched only if you are a die-hard fan of Suriya or action thrillers.
  
Anjaan has some interesting trivia behind its making. The film was shot extensively in Mumbai and Goa, with some scenes in Bulgaria and Malaysia. The film's title was initially announced as Raju Bhai, but was later changed to Anjaan to avoid confusion with another film of the same name. The film also marked the first collaboration between Suriya and Lingusamy, who had earlier planned to work together in Paiyaa and Vettai, but the projects did not materialize. The film also marked the second collaboration between Suriya and Vidyut Jammwal, who had earlier worked together in Thuppakki.
 
Anjaan also had some controversies during its release. The film's teaser was leaked online before its official launch, which angered the makers and prompted them to file a complaint with the cyber crime cell. The film's satellite rights were sold to Sun TV for a record price of â¹22 crore, which was later disputed by UTV Motion Pictures, who claimed that they had not authorized the deal. The film also faced piracy issues, as a pirated version of the film was uploaded online on the day of its release, which affected its box office collections.
 
Anjaan is a film that tried to cash in on the star power of Suriya and the popularity of the action genre, but failed to deliver a satisfying product. The film had some potential to be a stylish and engaging action thriller, but was let down by a weak script, poor direction, and a long runtime. The film is only recommended for hardcore fans of Suriya or action films, who can overlook the flaws and enjoy the film for its style and action.
