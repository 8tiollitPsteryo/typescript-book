- Network Sonar: A tool that scans your network and generates a detailed inventory of your devices, including their IP addresses, MAC addresses, hostnames, vendors, models, serial numbers, and more.
- Switch Port Mapper: A tool that maps the physical port connections of your switches to the devices connected to them, such as computers, printers, routers, etc.
- IP Network Browser: A tool that browses your IP network and displays information about each device, such as its type, status, services, interfaces, routes, etc.
- IP Address Management: A tool that helps you manage your IP address space, identify free and in-use IP addresses, monitor DHCP scopes, and more.

These tools can help you get a comprehensive view of your network structure and configuration, as well as identify any issues or anomalies.
 
## Network Monitoring and Alerting
 
Another important aspect of network management is to monitor and alert on the status and performance of your network devices and applications. Engineer's Toolset v9 12 offers several tools for network monitoring and alerting, such as:

- Network Performance Monitor: A tool that monitors the availability and response time of your network devices and applications using SNMP and ICMP protocols.
- SNMP Real-Time Graph: A tool that graphs the real-time performance data of any SNMP-enabled device or interface.
- CPU Monitor: A tool that monitors the CPU load of multiple devices simultaneously.
- Memory Monitor: A tool that monitors the memory usage of multiple devices simultaneously.
- Interface Monitor: A tool that monitors the bandwidth utilization and errors of multiple interfaces simultaneously.
- Advanced CPU Load: A tool that monitors the CPU load of multiple devices over time and generates historical reports.
- Advanced Subnet Calculator: A tool that calculates subnet information for any IP address or range.

These tools can help you keep track of the health and performance of your network devices and applications, as well as alert you when something goes wrong or exceeds a predefined threshold.
 
## Network Diagnostics
 
Sometimes, you may encounter network issues that require further investigation and troubleshooting. Engineer's Toolset v9 12 offers several tools for network diagnostics, such as:

- Ping: A tool that tests the connectivity and latency between two devices using ICMP packets.
- Ping Sweep: A tool that pings a range of IP addresses and displays their status.
- Traceroute: A tool that traces the path of packets from one device to another and displays the hop-by-hop information.
- DNS Analyzer: A tool that analyzes the DNS records of a domain name or IP address.
- DNS Audit: A tool that audits the DNS configuration of your network and identifies any errors or inconsistencies.
- Port Scanner: A tool that scans a device or range of devices for open TCP or UDP ports.
- TFTP Server: A tool that allows you to transfer files to or from your network devices using TFTP protocol.

These tools can help you diagnose and resolve network issues by providing useful information and functionality.
 
## Network Configuration
 
A key part of network management is to configure and maintain your network devices according to best practices and standards. Engineer's Toolset v9 12 offers several tools for network configuration, such as:
