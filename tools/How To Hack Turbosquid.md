## Step 3: Use a Proxy Site
 
The third step is to use a proxy site to access the model URL. A proxy site is a website that acts as an intermediary between you and another website, hiding your IP address and bypassing any restrictions or blocks. There are many free proxy sites available online, such as https://hide.me/en/proxy or https://www.hidemyass.com/en-us/proxy. You can choose any proxy site you like, as long as it works.
 
Once you have chosen a proxy site, paste the model URL into the input box and click on the button to go to the model page. You should see the same page as before, but with a different URL in the address bar.
 
## Step 4: Download the Model
 
The final step is to download the model from the proxy site. You should see a download button on the model page, usually near the top or bottom of the page. Click on it and save the file to your computer. You may need to unzip the file if it is compressed.
 
Congratulations! You have successfully hacked turbosquid and got a free 3D model. You can now use it for your personal or commercial projects, as long as you respect the original author's license and attribution.

## Alternative Methods to Get Free 3D Models
 
If you are looking for other ways to get free 3D models without hacking turbosquid, you may want to check out these alternative methods:
 
- **Use free 3D model websites.** There are many websites that offer free 3D models for download, such as https://free3d.com/, https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models, or https://sketchfab.com/tags/free. These websites usually have a large variety of models in different formats and categories, and some of them even allow you to preview the models in 3D before downloading.
- **Use open source 3D software.** There are also some open source 3D software that you can use to create your own 3D models, such as https://www.blender.org/, https://www.gimp.org/, or https://inkscape.org/. These software are free to download and use, and they have many features and tools to help you design and edit your models. You can also find tutorials and resources online to learn how to use them.
- **Use online 3D model generators.** Another option is to use online 3D model generators, such as https://www.tinkercad.com/, https://www.shapeways.com/creator/tools, or https://www.thingiverse.com/apps/customizer/run. These generators allow you to create simple 3D models by using predefined shapes, parameters, and settings. You can then download or print your models for free.

## Tips and Tricks to Hack Turbosquid Safely
 
If you still want to hack turbosquid and get free 3D models, you may want to follow these tips and tricks to do it safely and avoid getting caught:

- **Use a VPN service.** A VPN service is a software that encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a remote server, hiding your IP address and location from the websites you visit. This way, you can access turbosquid from a different country or region, and avoid being tracked or blocked by their security systems. There are many VPN services available online, such as https://www.expressvpn.com/, https://nordvpn.com/, or https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/.
- **Use a burner email account.** A burner email account is a temporary email account that you can use for a short period of time and then discard. This way, you can avoid using your personal or professional email account when hacking turbosquid, and avoid receiving spam or unwanted messages from them. You can create a burner email account using websites like https://temp-mail.org/en/, https://10minutemail.com/, or https://maildrop.cc/.
- **Use a fake name and address.** When hacking turbosquid, you may need to provide some personal information, such as your name and address, to download the models. However, you should never use your real name and address, as this may expose your identity and location to turbosquid or their partners. Instead, you should use a fake name and address that are not linked to you in any way. You can generate a fake name and address using websites like https://www.fakenamegenerator.com/, https://www.fakeaddressgenerator.com/, or https://randomuser.me/.
