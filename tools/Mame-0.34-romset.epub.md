However, to play these games, you need ROM files, which are the digital copies of the original arcade game chips. ROM files are usually stored in ZIP archives and have different formats depending on the MAME version they are compatible with.
 
One of the oldest and most popular MAME versions is MAME 0.34, which was released in 1997 and supports over 2000 games. MAME 0.34 ROM files have a specific format that is different from newer MAME versions. If you want to play MAME 0.34 games, you need to find a MAME 0.34 ROM set, which is a collection of all the compatible ROM files for that version.
 
A MAME 0.34 ROM set can be downloaded from various sources on the internet, such as archive.org[^1^] [^2^]. However, you may also want to convert newer MAME ROM files to MAME 0.34 format, if you have them already or if you cannot find the game you want in a MAME 0.34 ROM set.
 
To convert newer MAME ROM files to MAME 0.34 format, you need a tool called clrmamepro[^5^], which is a ROM manager that can verify, fix, and update your ROM files according to a datafile. A datafile is a file that contains information about the ROM files for a specific MAME version, such as their names, sizes, checksums, and dependencies.
 
You can find a MAME 0.34 datafile from logiqx.com[^4^], which is a website that provides datafiles for various MAME versions and other emulators. Once you have the datafile and clrmamepro installed, you can follow these steps to convert your newer MAME ROM files to MAME 0.34 format:
 
1. Launch clrmamepro and click on Create.
2. Select the MAME 0.34 datafile and click on OK.
3. Click on Settings and add your ROM paths where your newer MAME ROM files are located.
4. Click on Scanner and select Non-Merged mode and Separate BIOS sets under Advanced.
5. Select your ROM paths under Paths node and click on Fix.
6. Wait for clrmamepro to scan and fix your ROM files according to the MAME 0.34 datafile.

After the process is completed, you should have a MAME 0.34 ROM set in your ROM paths that you can use with a MAME 0.34 emulator. You can also use clrmamepro to verify and update your ROM set if needed.
