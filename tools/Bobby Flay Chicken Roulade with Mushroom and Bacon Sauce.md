- For the mustard sauce:
- 1/4 cup clover honey
- 1/4 cup Dijon mustard
- 1/4 cup whole-grain mustard
- 2 heaping tablespoons drained prepared horseradish
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- For the chicken roulade:
- 1/4 cup canola oil, plus more for drizzling
- 1 clove garlic, chopped into a paste
- Pinch of red chile flakes
- 4 ounces baby arugula
- Four 6-ounce boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 8 paper-thin slices country ham or prosciutto
- 8 ounces triple-cream cheese, such as Red Hawk
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- Micro arugula, for garnish

To make the mustard sauce, whisk together the honey, Dijon mustard, whole-grain mustard and horseradish in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper. Cover and let sit to allow the flavors to meld while you make the chicken.
 
To make the chicken roulade, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat 2 tablespoons of the canola oil over low heat in a large saute pan. Add the garlic and red chile flakes and cook for 30 seconds. Increase the heat, stir in the baby arugula, season with salt and pepper and cook until just wilted, about 2 minutes. Set aside.
 
Drizzle the chicken breasts with a little oil and thinly pound between 2 sheets of parchment paper or plastic wrap. Put the breasts on a flat surface skin-side down, and sprinkle the top sides with salt and pepper. Place 2 slices of the ham on each breast; spread 2 ounces of the cheese over the ham and then top with one-quarter of the arugula in the center. Roll the breasts tightly and tie with butcher's twine. Sprinkle the roulade with salt and pepper.
 
Heat a large ovenproof saute pan over high heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and cook until it begins to shimmer. Put the rolls in the pan seam-side up and add the butter. Cook until golden brown on all sides, about 3 minutes. Transfer the pan to the oven and continue cooking until the breasts are just cooked through and the cheese has melted, 4 to 5 minutes.
 
Remove the rolls to a plate and let rest 5 minutes before slicing. Serve with the mustard sauce and topped with a bit of micro arugula.

- Use a sharp knife to cut the chicken breasts horizontally into thin slices. This will make it easier to pound them and roll them up.
- Use a meat thermometer to check the doneness of the chicken. The internal temperature should be 165 degrees F when inserted into the thickest part of the roulade.
- Let the roulades rest for 5 minutes before slicing. This will allow the juices and cheese to redistribute and prevent them from spilling out.
- If you can't find American triple cream cheese, you can substitute with brie or camembert. If you can't find Georgia ham, you can use any thinly sliced cured ham.
- You can make the mustard sauce ahead of time and refrigerate it until ready to serve. You can also warm it up slightly in a microwave or a small saucepan if you prefer.

This roasted chicken roulade recipe is a great way to impress your guests with a restaurant-quality dish that is easy to make at home. Enjoy it with a green salad, roasted potatoes or rice pilaf for a complete meal.
