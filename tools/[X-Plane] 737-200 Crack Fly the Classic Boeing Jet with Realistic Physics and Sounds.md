The Boeing 737-200 is a short-to-medium range narrow-body aircraft that can carry up to 136 passengers and has a range of up to 2,600 nautical miles. It is powered by two Pratt & Whitney JT8D turbofan engines that produce up to 15,500 pounds of thrust each. The 737-200 has a distinctive T-tail and rear-mounted engines that give it a unique appearance and sound.
 
There are several ways to fly the Boeing 737-200 in X-Plane, depending on the level of realism and complexity that users prefer. Here are some of the options available:
 
- FlyJSim 732 TwinJet V3 Pro: This is a highly detailed and accurate add-on that models the 737-200 Advanced with JT8D-15A engines and SP-77 autopilot. It features a fully functional 3D cockpit, custom sounds, interactive cabin, liveries, and more. It also utilizes X-Plane's physics based rendering and vector based flight dynamics to provide a realistic visual and auditory experience. The add-on costs $49.95 USD and can be purchased from the X-Plane.org Software Store[^1^].
- B737-200A\_x10\_N7560V: This is a freeware add-on that models the 737-201 with custom avionics and plugin scripts. It has a basic 3D cockpit, custom sounds, liveries, and more. It also includes checklists, references, and specifications for flying the aircraft according to real procedures. The add-on can be downloaded from the X-Plane.org Forum[^2^].
- Take Command!: IXEG 737 Classic: This is another highly detailed and accurate add-on that models the 737-300 with CFM56 engines and SP-177 autopilot. It features a fully functional 3D cockpit, custom sounds, interactive cabin, liveries, and more. It also utilizes X-Plane's physics based rendering and vector based flight dynamics to provide a realistic visual and auditory experience. The add-on costs $74.95 USD and can be purchased from X-Aviation[^3^].

Whichever option users choose, they can enjoy flying the Boeing 737-200 in X-Plane and experience the jet age with this classic aircraft.

Before flying the Boeing 737-200 in X-Plane, users need to familiarize themselves with the cockpit layout and the basic procedures for starting up, taxiing, taking off, cruising, descending, landing, and shutting down the aircraft. The cockpit of the 737-200 is divided into several sections: the overhead panel, the main instrument panel, the center pedestal, and the glareshield. Each section contains various switches, knobs, gauges, indicators, and displays that control and monitor different systems and functions of the aircraft.
 
The overhead panel contains switches and controls for the electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, fuel, lighting, fire protection, and anti-ice systems. The main instrument panel contains the primary flight instruments for the pilot and co-pilot, such as the airspeed indicator, attitude indicator, altimeter, vertical speed indicator, heading indicator, horizontal situation indicator, and turn coordinator. It also contains the engine instruments, such as the exhaust gas temperature gauge, N1 and N2 indicators, fuel flow gauge, oil pressure and temperature gauges, and thrust reverser indicators. The center pedestal contains the throttle quadrant, which includes the thrust levers, flap lever, speed brake lever, parking brake lever, and stabilizer trim wheel. It also contains the radio and navigation equipment, such as the communication radios, navigation radios, transponder, automatic direction finder (ADF), distance measuring equipment (DME), and very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) receivers. The glareshield contains the autopilot panel, which includes the mode selector panel (MSP), flight director panel (FDP), altitude alert panel (AAP), and pitch command indicator (PCI). It also contains the master caution system (MCS), which consists of two master caution lights and six system annunciator lights.
 
The basic procedures for flying the 737-200 in X-Plane are similar to those of real pilots who flew this aircraft. Users need to follow a series of steps to prepare the aircraft for flight and operate it safely and efficiently. These steps include:

- Performing a preflight inspection of the exterior and interior of the aircraft.
- Setting up the cockpit according to the desired configuration and flight plan.
- Starting up the engines using either external power or air start cart.
- Requesting clearance from ATC and taxiing to the runway.
- Taking off using either VOR or RNAV departure procedures.
- Climbing to cruise altitude using either VOR or RNAV enroute procedures.
- Cruising at a constant speed and altitude using either manual or autopilot control.
- Descending to approach altitude using either VOR or RNAV arrival procedures.
- Landing using either VOR or RNAV approach procedures.
- Taxiing to the gate and shutting down the engines.

Flying the Boeing 737-200 in X-Plane can be a fun and rewarding experience for users of all skill levels. Users can learn more about this aircraft by reading the manuals and tutorials provided by the add-on developers or by watching videos and streams of other users flying it. Users can also join online communities and forums where they can share their experiences and tips with other 737-200 enthusiasts.
