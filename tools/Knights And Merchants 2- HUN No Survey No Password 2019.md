Knights and Merchants 2 was supposed to be the follow-up to the 1998 real-time strategy game Knights and Merchants: The Shattered Kingdom, which featured a complex economy system, realistic medieval warfare, and a rich historical setting. However, the sequel was never released due to development issues and changing market trends.
 
The original Knights and Merchants game was developed by Joymania Development and published by TopWare Interactive. It received positive reviews from critics and fans for its detailed graphics, challenging gameplay, and immersive atmosphere. The game was set in a fictional kingdom that had been divided into several provinces after a civil war. The player took on the role of a loyal captain who had to help the king restore his authority and defeat the rebel lords.

In 2001, an expansion pack called The Peasants Rebellion was released, which added new missions, units, buildings, and features to the game. The expansion also improved the game's stability and compatibility with modern systems. The Peasants Rebellion is still available on digital platforms such as GOG.com and Steam.

However, many fans were eagerly waiting for a true sequel that would continue the story and introduce new innovations to the game. According to Peter Ohlmann, one of the lead designers of Knights and Merchants, the development of Knights and Merchants 2 started shortly after The Peasants Rebellion had been finished. He and another designer, Adam Sprys, joined Similis Software, a company that had worked on the Cultures series of games.
 
The initial plan was to make Knights and Merchants 2 a 2D game with improved graphics and gameplay. The game used "Princedom" as a working title and a prototype was completed in summer 2002. However, the developers faced some challenges with this approach. They had difficulty finding a publisher who would support a 2D game in an era where 3D games were becoming more popular. They also had trouble working with the artistic style of the game, which was different from their previous projects.
 
As a result, the decision was made to switch to 3D graphics and restart the development of the game. This proved to be a fatal mistake, as the team had little experience with 3D technology and had to learn everything from scratch. The development process became slow and chaotic, and the game's quality suffered. Moreover, the team had to deal with financial problems, internal conflicts, and legal issues with TopWare Interactive over the rights to the Knights and Merchants brand.
 
Eventually, Knights and Merchants 2 was cancelled in 2004 due to lack of funding and interest from publishers. The game never saw the light of day and remains one of the most anticipated but never released strategy games of all time. Some screenshots and videos of the game have been leaked online over the years, but they only show how far the game was from being finished.
 
Knights and Merchants 2 is a sad example of how a promising sequel can be ruined by poor management, unrealistic expectations, and changing market trends. However, it also shows how much passion and dedication the developers had for their game and how much they wanted to make it a worthy successor to their masterpiece. Perhaps one day, someone will revive this project and give it the justice it deserves.
