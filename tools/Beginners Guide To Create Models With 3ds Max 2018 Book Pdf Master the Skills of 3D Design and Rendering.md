In this section, we will give you a brief overview of the main features and tools of 3ds Max 2018 that you will learn in the book. 3ds Max 2018 is a powerful and versatile software that allows you to create 3D models for various purposes and industries. You can use 3ds Max 2018 to create models for games, animation, visual effects, architecture, engineering, design, and more. 3ds Max 2018 has a user-friendly interface that consists of four main areas: the viewport, the ribbon, the command panel, and the menu bar. The viewport is where you can view and manipulate your 3D scene. The ribbon is a toolbar that contains various tools and commands for modeling, animation, rendering, and more. The command panel is a set of tabs that provide access to different modes and functions of 3ds Max 2018, such as create, modify, hierarchy, motion, display, and utilities. The menu bar is located at the top of the screen and contains menus for file operations, editing, tools, views, rendering, customization, and help.
 
One of the most important aspects of 3D modeling is creating and editing geometry. Geometry is the term used to describe the shapes and objects that make up your 3D scene. In 3ds Max 2018, you can create geometry using two methods: primitives and shapes. Primitives are basic shapes that are predefined in 3ds Max 2018, such as spheres, cubes, cylinders, cones, tori, pyramids, and more. Shapes are lines or curves that can be drawn in 2D or 3D space using tools such as line, rectangle, circle, arc, star, text, and more. You can use primitives and shapes as building blocks for your models or as guides for other modeling techniques.
 
Once you have created geometry in your scene, you can modify it using various tools and commands in 3ds Max 2018. You can transform geometry by moving, rotating, scaling, aligning, mirroring, or snapping it to other objects or coordinates. You can edit geometry by adding or deleting vertices (points), edges (lines), faces (polygons), or elements (groups of faces). You can also use modifiers to change the shape or appearance of geometry without altering its original structure. Modifiers are operations that can be applied to geometry in a non-destructive way. For example, you can use modifiers to bend, twist, taper, extrude, bevel, smooth, subdivide, or deform geometry. You can also use modifiers to add details such as noise, displacement maps (bumps), hair and fur (strands), cloth (fabric), or skin (muscles) to your models.
